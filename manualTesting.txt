Testing System: Soda Vending Machine 

The objective of this test will be to test the soda vending machine and its functionality. These will be a series of tests in which the core functionality of the soda vending machine will be verified.

Priority of the business: Based on the priority of the business this will determinate which features are of the most important and how much testing time will be dedicated to each feature

Core Funcionality:

Test Case: Check that the soda vending machine is powered on.
Test Case: Select a product and check the price is given on display
Test Case: Check to see what the selected currency is, and if user enters incorrect currency machine should display error
Test Case: Input Money, Select Soda, Vending Machine Dispenses Soda, machine returns change from initial balance
Test Case: Input Exact amount, Select Soda, Vending Machine Dispenses Soda, no money returned
Test Case: input insufficient money, select soda, machine notifies the buyer for insufficient balance and not dispense soda
Test Case: Input Money, Select soda, machine dispenses the selected soda
Test Case: Input money, user selects soda, user changes their selection, hits the cancel button, machine should cancel order and return money
Test Case: Input money, user selects soda, selected soda is out of stock, machine should display out of stock and return money if no other choice selected
Test Case: Check that the soda vending machine contains a min/max amount of money that can be inputed. 
	- Input less than minimum amount, select soda, provide error that insufficient funds entered
	- Input more than max amount, select soda, provide in display that max amount of money reached and will disperse back amount entered
Test Case: Make sure all the digits that the user would need to press are available 
Test Case: User inputs money, selects soda, as soda is being dispersed it gets stuck in the dispertion tube, system should provide an alert & cease further operations
Test Case: Check to see min/max of refrigeration temperature 
    - if system temparature is too hot then turn on cooler 
    - if system temparature is too low thturn off cooler. 
Test Case: User selects more then one item in one transaction: enter money, select soda, then would need to re-enter money
        - if I re-enter the soda selection after entering the first selection what does it do.
        - If battery or electricity is interrupted during transaction, machine should resume process and disperses soda
    Testing Case: Select Soda, enter price amount through a combination of coins & cash, the selected soda should be provided

During the though process of creating test, I based my reasoning on providing maximum test coverage under time restraints.In these test suites the main objective will be that the soda vending machine is working as intended if any new changes will be introduced.
